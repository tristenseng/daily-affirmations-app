## Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first approach



## What I learned

- (CSS) ::before & ::after pseudo elements allowed me to insert content onto the page without it being in the html.


- (HTML) There can never be enough 'containers'. Everything should be in a box. It makes it easier to manipulate and move things around.


- JS is easier to learn than CSS lol
